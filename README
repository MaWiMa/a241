== description
Sketch of self and foreign assessment of a pupil in one subject. Both assessments are described by four sub-assessments, named social skills (Sozialkompetenz), independence (Selbstst√§ndigkeit), skills (Fertigkeiten) and knowledge (Wissen).

The four competences of each assessment are layered.

Besides (a) grade, characteristics are drawn in one place through

(b) bold and simple strength-weakness distribution, shown with uniform or uneven arrangement of competences in one assessment, 

(c) correlation of self and foreign assessment, shown with similarity or diversity of assessment layers.

The visualization is done by reading csv data through scripts, which generate images. The assessments are shown in one dominant area on two layers and in two seperated areas on the right side of the image.
This is done with three radar charts.

You should find your local pages under pages/a241/. To get the visualized data open pages/a241/index.html with your webbrowser.

== scripting
makePages.rb makes linked hmtl pages which are written to folder pages/a241.
There must be a parameter with the filename of the file you want to parse.
The parsed file should, but not must, be found in folder data/csv/.
You can run for example:

ruby makePages.rb data/csv/data.csv


The script a241.rb makes svg-images of the parsed data from a csv file to show self and foreign assessment of a pupil in one subject.
If you only want to make the svg-files, then just run:

ruby a241.rb data/csv/data.csv

You may delete all temporary files with:

ruby deletePages.rb

First fill a csv file with data.
The (header of the) csv-file should look like this:

class,name,ssoz,ssel,sfer,swis,subject,fsoz,fsel,ffer,fwis,teacher,date,height

(examples are shown in simple.rb and sample.rb)

If you have data (without header) in following (formerly used) form use sample.rb to generate a csv file:

Class LastName-FirstName self assessment subject assessment teacher date
AV01 Rom-Peter 3 2 3 3 m 2 1 3 3 REK 2018-01-12

Next steps are only possible if file data/data.csv exists.
If you want to generate data for only one pupil, use ruby makePupil.rb.
Generating data for one class is done with ruby makeClass.rb.
