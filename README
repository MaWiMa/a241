------------------------------------------------------------------
a241.rb makes an image to show self and foreign assessment of a pupil in one subject. For both assessments there have to be four sub-assessments, named social skills (Sozialkompetenz), independence (Selbstst√§ndigkeit)
skills (Fertigkeiten) and knowledge (Wissen).

makePages.rb makes linked hmtl pages for all svg files in dir images.
html pages are written to dir site.

make.sh does make many svg files and the relating hmtl files at once for one class if file Data.CLASS exist (where extension CLASS is the name of the class).

deletePages.rb cleans the directories images, site and txt.
